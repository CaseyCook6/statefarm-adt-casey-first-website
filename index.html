        <p>I was born in Bloomington, and when I was young we moved like 20 miles down the road to Normal.</p>

        <h1>Places I Want To Visit</h1>
        <p>I want to visit Denver because it's surrounded by mountains, which are my favorite things. I want to visit Seattle and Portland because I love the climates and the scenery.</p>
